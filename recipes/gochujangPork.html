    <p>
      These gochujang pork belly bites are sweet and spicy, crispy and crunchy,
    </p>
    <p>
      and absolutely delicious. Whether you finish them with the gochujang sauce
      in the air fryer,
    </p>
    <p>or just dip them in the sauce at the end, they are irresistibly good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound pork belly, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup gochujang</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot honey, such as Mike'sÂ® Hot Honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place pork belly pieces in the basket in a single layer, not touching.
        Air fry for 8 to 9 minutes; turn over and air fry for 6 to 7 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, for sauce, stir gochujang, soy sauce, hot honey, and ginger
        together in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pork belly from air fryer basket; toss in sauce to coat. Return
        to the air fryer and fry until bites begin to char at the edges, 8 to 11
        minutes more. (Alternately, you can use sauce only for dipping; in this
        case, continue to fry without removing bites, until they begin to char,
        6 to 7 minutes.)
      </li>
    </ol>
